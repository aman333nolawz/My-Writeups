Anyone who’s spent more than a handful of seconds on the       	
internet has encountered spam. It’s seemingly an inseparable 		 	   
part of the internet experience, something we accept as 			 	  
normal. Spamming is the act of sending these messages, and a 			 	  
person who engages in the practice is a spammer. Most of the 			    
time, spamming is commercial in nature, and though the spam 			  		
is bothersome, it isn’t necessarily malicious or fraudulent  			 	 
(though it can be).
